# Round 8 — C05, D04

2 sessions, then `/evolve`. Do them in order; `lab next` always picks the right one.

## Each session

1. In a terminal: `lab next`. A teammate's commit lands in cortex-lab, and the prompt is printed.
2. Open a **new** Claude Code chat in cortex-lab and check the model is **Haiku 4.5**.
   Paste the prompt exactly as printed. Let Claude work, and approve what it asks.
3. When Claude says it is done: `lab verify`.
   - `✘ …` + a reply → paste the reply into the **same** chat, let Claude fix, run `lab verify` again.
   - `✔ …` → go on.
4. Type `/harvest` in the **same** chat. Wait for its one-line report.
5. `lab done`: it records the session and commits everything.

Claude asks nothing: your global default is bypassPermissions. If it stalls or loops, stop it and tell me.

## This round's sessions

Here for reference: `lab next` prints the same text.

### C05 — HTML export (family C: new exporter)

> We want to e-mail order tables. Please add an `html` export format (a <table>, one row per order line). The tests are in tests/test_export_html.py.

### D04 — business days skip Saturdays (family D: control)

> Delivery estimates land on Saturdays: add_business_days() counts Saturday as a working day. QA added tests/test_business_days_weekend.py. Please fix it.

## Then `/evolve`

1. Open a **new** chat (Haiku 4.5) and type `/evolve`.
2. It runs preflight, reads the lessons and either stops (**BARREN**: nothing recurs yet) or
   writes one candidate and launches a **screen** sweep in the background, then says it will be back.
3. Wait for the sweep. In a terminal inside cortex-lab, `cortex score | jq -c '{phase,rollouts,finished}'` shows progress.
   A screen is ~8–16 rollouts (10–20 min); a confirm is tasks × 6 rollouts.
4. When `finished` is `true`, type `/evolve` again (same chat or a new one). It reads the result and
   either stops (KILL) or launches the next sweep: the **confirm**, or a small **recheck**.
5. Repeat 3–4 until it reports **KEEP**, **KILL** or **BARREN** and writes the journal.
6. In a terminal: `lab commit` (commits the new skill or rule, the journal and the baseline).

**What should happen this round:** same → BARREN.

If `/evolve` asks you a question, or something looks wrong, don't fix it by hand: tell me.

**Then tell me "round 8 done".** Don't start round 9 before I have checked.
